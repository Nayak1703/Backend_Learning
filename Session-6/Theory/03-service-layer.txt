Till now controller-function inside the controllers-file have responsible to 
    1.  Take request
    2.  Do the business logic based on request (interaction with db)
    3.  Sending response based on the request.

Controller-function should ony take care of the flow of the data (receving / responding request)
all the business-logic of the application should kept different from controller-function

So we will make a service layer to abstract the business-logic from the application.
by making a services folder and inside the services folder we will make service file.
inside the services-file we will add the business-logic related to interaction with database.

service-file should:
    1.  Contain business logic
    2.  Leverage the data access layer to interacte with database
    3.  Be framework agnostic (we separate the business-logic to different file because if our
        backend-server changes to different tech (express - django,etc...) in that case we just
        have to import the business-logic. means business-logic in independent of the server 
        tech).

Services-file Should not:
    1.  have access of req & res object
    2.  handle responding to te client.
    3.  should not contain any request-method, header, http, etc...
    4.  Directly interact with the database (weâ€™ll use models layer for it)

means services-file should contain only pure business-logic nothing else.
