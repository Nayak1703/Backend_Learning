1. If you see session-2's index.js page we have 2 endpoints and under that 2 endpoints we have multiple routes

    // currencies:
        app.get("/currencies", getCurrencies);
        app.get("/currencies/:symbol", getCurrencyBySymbol);

    // users:
        app.get("/users", getAllUsers);
        app.get("/users/search", getUserBySearch);
        app.get("/users/:uuid", getUserByUUID);


2. Now, suppose we want to add more routes (>=15 routes) under /currencies and /users, or add more request method to 
same route (get,post,put,delete,path) to /currencies and /users.
Or we want to remove all the routes of specific endpoint then we have to add or comment/delete all the routes manually. 
if we add the routes like we did above then it will look somethine like below:

        // currencies:
            app.get("/currencies", getCurrencies);
            app.get("/currencies/:symbol", getCurrencyBySymbol);
            .
            .
            .

        // users:
            app.post("/users", getAllUsers); 
            app.put("/users", getAllUsers);
            app.delete("/users", getAllUsers);
            app.patch("/users", getAllUsers);
            app.put("/users/:uuid", getUserByUUID)
            app.delete("/users/:uuid", getUserByUUID)
            app.patch("/users/:uuid", getUserByUUID)
            app.get("/users/group", getUserByUUID)
            .
            .
            .


3. Our Code should be readble and accessible, we should avoid to write bulky code, to achive this 
We got, Express's Routes:
Express's Routes is nothing but a way to write our routes in our project so that out code didnt become bulky,
and it should be readble.


4. To achive that we have to write all our routes in different file within "routes" folder and, import & use those file.
   Like we do in "controllers".
   Make sure you write all the routes of a endpoint in different file.
   eg: suppose i want to define the routes under /currencies, so i will make a file of name currencies.routes.js
       and inside it define all my routes which will come under /currencies,
       for routes under /users enpoint you should different file and define its routes.

   follow below steps (also see the routes-folder and its files):
    -   1.  make a folder name routes.

    -   2.  make a js files as per your requirement, and named it as endpoint.routes.js.
            eg: suppose i want to add muitple routes on /users endpoint so my file name will be users.routes.js

    -   3.  Now import Router() method from express, inside all the routes-files within routes-folder
            const router = require("express").Router()

    -   4.  now use "router" insted of "app" to define the routes of that particular endpoint.
            eg: previously we write our route like this:  
                [ 
                    const express = require("express") 
                    const app = express()

                    app.get("/", callBack-func)
                    app.post("/:symbol", callBack-func)
                    ...
                ]
            But now we can use "instance" of Router() method which return object, which we have assigne to "router" 
            variable. in place of "router" variable we can write any name.
            so,
                [
                    const router = required("express").Router()

                    router.get("/group", callBack-func)
                    router.post("/group", callBack-func)
                ]
            Define all the routes you want under the endpoint in this file

    -   5.  As you can see that we are using the callBack-function here (route-function /controller-function) 
            so we have to import our controller-function in this file.
            eg:
                const { getCurrencies, getCurrencyBySymbol} = require("../controllers/currencies.controllers.js");

    -   6.  Now export the "router" which is instance of express's Router() method, 
            here "router" is an object and it has key called stack and its value have array of objects.
            the number of object will the same as routes we have define for that endpoint.
            inside that object we have all detailes about that route.
            eg:
                module.exports = router;
    
    -   7.  Go to index.js file
            import all the routes-file stored in variables, which we have define inisde routes-folder
            now use app.use() method to define which routes-file should execute on particular endpoint
            app.use() takes 2 parameter:
                1. endpoint which is in string format eg: "/users", "/currencies", etc...
                2. adding routes-file's variable that we have imported from routes-folder.
                    eg:
                        app.use("/users", userRoutes);
                        app.use("/currencies", currencyRoutes);
