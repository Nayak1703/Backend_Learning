============>   JOI   <============

-   When client send data in request, client is accepting some response based on data he provided. 
-   Before processing the data in server, we should always validate the data sent by client.
-   This process secure our server and database from bad-data, it also increase the error-handling.

-   Till now to validate data we are doing it by ourself (writing all the code to validate the request-data)
-   But we can use some package that does these validation for ourself.
-   That package is called "Joi", it doesn't have any fullform

-   "Joi" is data-validator for Javascript mostly used with Node.js, "Joi" ensures that the data your
    application handles should be valid and structured correctly.
-   "Joi" does this by making schema to validate data.
-   schema: it the rule or structure we define for the data. 
    like (type-of-data, any condition that data should fullfill)
-   "Joi" also return appropriate error-message if data doesn't full the validation

-   This helps to do maintain
    Data-valiation: Ensure that correct data should only passed.
    Error-handling: if data does not validate throw a appropriate error.
    Readability: due to less code and english-syntax it makes user to understand and write the code.



============>   How to use JOI?   <============

1.      npm install joi;

2.      const Joi = require('joi');

3.      const schema = Joi.object({
        });

4.      check users.controller.js file for joi's validation
