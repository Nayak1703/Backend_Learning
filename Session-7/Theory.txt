To see the Layered-Architecture of the request-response cycle see the slides given by crio.
this architecture helps us to debug (helps us to locate where actual error has been occur)


The request passes through each layer in order:
    index.js -> router -> middelware -> controllers -> services -> models -> database

So with this architecture we can identify which part of our application is causing a problem, by log statements to 
check where the request reached.



Approach to debug:
    -   Move with flow shown in above architecture.
    -   Console log the errors on layer level to identify till where did our request reach.
    -   Use try-catch for error handling.
    -   if you are sending json data as response use express.json() in your code
    -   check for spelling mistake, do you have done proper destructuring.
