===========>    Intro to HTTP Server    <============

-   We can make backend server using node.js

-   To make backend-server we required 
        host: address where our server is accessible,   example: ip-address, localhost  
        port: the port (gateway) of the machine where the server application is running, there are more than 
              65000 ports present in the machine. we can access those port from outside the server 
    and backend-server should take a request and give a response based on request.

-   We can create backend-server by using [ http ] module it take a callback function and inside callback we give 
    host and port number to access the backend-server



===========>    What is HTTP module and How to write HTTP Server in node.js   <============

-   HTTP module (code file) is provided by node.js, which we will use in our project.

-   Go inside the project folder.
-   npm init  ->  To initialize the npm inside the project folder.
-   npm i <package-name>  ->  Install package you want to use in your project
        * In this case i am installing "nodemon" (devDependencies) to make backup server live  -> [ npm i nodemon -D ]
-   Make a index.js file to write backend-code

-   const http = require("http");  ->   We are requiring/Importing "http" in out project to access it.
-   const server = http.createServer();   ->   to create the server using http module.

-   see the index.js code
