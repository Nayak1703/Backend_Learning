So far, we have created a JWT token in the backend server and sent it to the client as a cookie.
However, we want to verify subsequent request from the client by checking its JWT token from cookie 
to verify the userâ€™s authenticity.

1.  see AuthUsingJWT.middleware.js file to know how to verify the jwt-token for authorization using JWT.

OR

2.  now we will use Passport package to verify the token.

    -   npm i passport passport-jwt: 
            passport: passport package
            passport-jwt: since we are using jwt-token, so we will use passport-jwt (strategy) package to 
                          verify the jwt token. There are 500+ strategy/configuraton in passport.

    -   make config-folder and inside it make passport.js
            see the /config/passport.js, index.js, AuthUsingPassport.middleware.js,
            user.routers.js file for future details.
    
    -
