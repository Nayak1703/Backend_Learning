=======>    Before Hashing Password     <=======

    -   There is problem in our code.
    -   who ever have access of the DB like (DB-admin, owner of the company, powerfull person) can see our password,
        which is very big security threat.


=======>    Understanding Encoding, Encryption, Hashing     <=======

    -   What is Encoding?

        *   Encoding is the process to convert the data into standard format.
        *   Because 2 lanuages/platforms consider same character differently.
        *   eg:
                our machine is stored everything in numbers,
                Hello -> UTF-8 encoding -> 72 101 108 108 111 (decimal) -> later it will convert to binary
        *   there are various type of encoding: ASCII, UTF-8, Base64, URL, etc...
        *   the main idea behind encoding iso ensures that the data can be understood by different systems 
            (like computers, programs, and devices) and can be transferred correctly over networks.
        *   Encoding generally is not used for security because encoded-data's pattern is crealy visible.     


    -   What is Encryption?

        *   Encryption is the process where we use algorithm to secure sensitive information such as passwords, 
            credit card numbers, emails, or any private data in digital systems.   
        *   The idea behind the encryption is to prevent unauthorized access
        *   To access / read the encrpted data we need proper key decrypt-key.
        *   There are 2 type of encryption Symmetric & Asymmetric.
        *   In Symmetric both the sender and reciver uses same key for both encrypt/decrypt the data.
            it increase the speed & efficiency but decrease the security.  
        *   In Asymmetric both the sender and reciver have public-private key pair,
            when first time sender & reciver establish the connection they share there public key to eachother.

            now sender have: public-key, private-key, public-key-of-reciver.
            now reciver have: public-key, private-key, public-key-of-sender.

            before sender sends any data to reciver, sender use public-key-of-reciver to decrypt the data
            and then send the data to reciver.
            reciver recives the data, since the data in encrpyted by reciver-public-key so reciver can decrypt the
            data using reciver private-key because reciver have corresponding private-key to public-key.

            if data is capture by hacker, then also hacker cant decrypt the data because it dont have
            private-key of the reciver.
        *   example of the encryption algorithm: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard),
            RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), etc...

    -   What is hashing?
        
        *   hashing is a process used in computer-science to transform data into a fixed size value or key.
        *   This transformation is done usng special algorithm called hash-function (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc...).
        *   The result of applying the functions is called a hash-value (or hash-code, hash-sum, or digest)
        *   hashing is used in various field like: Data storage & retrieval, Data Integrity, cryptography
        *   it is very difficult to reverse the hashed-value to its original input.
        *   eg:
                Password: "mypassword123"
                Hash("mypassword123") â†’ 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6 
        *   above example shows, password entered by user is hashed like this and stored in DB so no-one can get to 
            know the orginal input enter by the user.
        *   to make hashed-data more difficult to reverse we can add some random data to the actual-data
            and then hashed it, this will make data more secure and uncrackable.
        *   adding random data to actual data is called salt in techincal-language.
        *   each extra data on actual data, increase the complexity of the hashed-data.
        *   note: some of the hashed-algo has shown some vernabilities and can be crackbale liek (md5)
        *   see crio's ppt or internet for hashing visual representation.
