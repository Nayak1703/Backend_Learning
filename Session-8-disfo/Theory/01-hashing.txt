        for simplicity we will use bcrypt-package
    -   this package provide us funcationlity of the adding-salt, hashing, verify string.

    -   this is business-logic so we will using this hashing-algo in sevices.

        {
            "username": "Radha-raman",

            "email": "rara@golok.com",
            "password": "$2b$10$JsbjA6wEKHg8u1r9Zm2GxeUeVm7MDy6ed8mrrRRwatK4CYIwnCTtC",
            "_id": "66d9808fc3dfb6a0b56fbf59",
            "__v": 0
